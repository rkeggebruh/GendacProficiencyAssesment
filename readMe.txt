To run this project, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Set Up the Backend Server:

    The backend server is built using Node.js and Express.js.
    Navigate to the directory where your script.js file is located.
    Install Node.js if you haven't already.
    Open a terminal in that directory and run npm install express to install Express.js.
    Then run node script.js to start the server. You should see a message indicating that the server is running at http://localhost:3000.

2. Set Up the Frontend:

    The frontend is an HTML file (index.html), a CSS file (style.css), and a JavaScript file (script.js).
    Make sure you have a modern web browser installed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
    Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Using and interacting with the Application:

Once the server is running and you've opened the index.html file in your browser, you should see the product management interface.
You can create new products, update existing ones, delete products, and search/filter through the product list.

Once you're done using the application, you can close the web browser window and stop the Node.js server by pressing Ctrl + C in the terminal where it's running.
